# SHINBAY OMAKASE APP

This project is an experimental menu management app for Shinbay restaurant opening in early 2019 in Scottsdale, AZ.

Omakase means, "I'll leave it up to you" in Japanese. The chef will generally present a series of plates. Customers ordering Omakase style expect the chef to be innovative and surprising.

Omakase requires a different menu managing protocol due to its frequent changing of the menu text. The Challenge will be for the app to automatically format the menu layout so that it displays nicely on both print and digital media whenever new changes are made to the menu text.

With an Omakase App, the restaurant manager can create a consistent high quality menu design that can be printed on paper, digitally displayed on different size screens and shared via  email and FACEBOOK.
